# ether-type
A minimalistic no-std crate for parsing ether types as specified in IEEE 802.3.
## Completeness
As this crate aims to be minimalistic not all ether types will be included. 
The most relevant ones like ARP, IPv4|6 and Wake on LAN will ofcourse be present.
If you are missing an EtherType that you need feel free to open a PR.
